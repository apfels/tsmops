= TsMops – MOPS in your Browser
An implementation of the MOPS system in TypeScript.

== What is MOPS, and TsMops
*MOPS* is an educational virtual computer originally implemented in python. While _free as in beer_ freeware, MOPS is not _free as in freedom_ Free Software, and its source code is not publicly available. In addition, original MOPS is no longer maintained. Original MOPS may be found http://www.viktorianer.de/info/mops.html[here]. (third party site)

*TsMops* is a Free implementation of the virtual assembler and hardware platform defined by MOPS, in TypeScript. It is designed to run client-side in any modern web browser. In its default mode, both the assembler and virtual hardware try to closely emulate original MOPS behavior; however, a number of syntax extensions are available, and will be discussed later.

== The MOPS Platform
MOPS bytes are exclusively interpreted as integers in the range [-9999, 9999]. The system memory is 72 bytes, of which the first 64 are reserved for program code, and the remaining eight are for data.

|========================================================================================
| Mnemonic  | Opcode | Explanation.
| nop†      | 00     | No Operation.
| ld _adr_  | 10     | Load value at _adr_ into _acc_.
| ld _val_  | 11     | Load value _val_ into _acc_.
| st _adr_  | 12     | Store _acc_ at _adr_.
| in _adr_  | 20     | Store next input value at _adr_.
| out _adr_ | 22     | Write value at _adr_ to _out_.
| out _val_ | 23     | Write value _val_ to _out_.
| add _adr_ | 30     | Add value at _adr_ to _acc_.
| add _val_ | 31     | Add value _val_ to _acc_.
| sub _adr_ | 32     | Subtract value at _adr_ from _acc_.
| sub _val_ | 33     | Subtract value _val_ from _acc_.
| mul _adr_ | 34     | Multiply _acc_ by value at _adr_.
| mul _val_ | 35     | Multiply _acc_ by value _val_.
| div _adr_ | 36     | Divide _acc_ by value at _adr_.
| div _val_ | 37     | Divide _acc_ by value _val_.
| mod _adr_ | 38     | Remainder of truncated divide _acc_ by value at _adr_.
| mod _val_ | 39     | Remainder of truncated divide _acc_ by value _val_.
| cmp _adr_ | 40     | Compare _acc_ to value at _val_.
| cmp _adr_ | 41     | Compare _acc_ to value _val_.
| jmp _tar_ | 50     | Unconditionally jump to reference _tar_.
| jlt _tar_ | 52     | Jump to reference _tar_ if the latest comparison had _acc_ *<* _opd_.
| jeq _tar_ | 54     | Jump to reference _tar_ if the latest comparison had _acc_ *=* _opd_.
| jgt _tar_ | 56     | Jump to reference _tar_ if the latest comparison had _acc_ *>* _opd_.
| end       | 60     | End of program. Halt.
|========================================================================================
† _nop_ is a TsMops extension. Original MOPS does not recognize this mnemonic.

== TsMops Syntax Extensions
- _Initial Whitespace_: Allow lines containing a mnemonic to start with whitespace. This whitespace will be disregarded.
- _Multiple Labels_: Allow multiple label definitions on a single line.
- _Empty Line Jumps_: Allow jumping to lines that do not translate to an instruction, and allow label definitions on those lines.
- _Jump to Address_: Allow an address literal as argument for jumps. The address will not be linked, but added to the binary as-is.
- _Past End_: Allow control flow past an _end_ instruction. Programs do not need to contain an _end_ instruction. Execution will _not_ be halted if no end instruction is encountered.
- _Nop_: Allow the _nop_ mnemonic that translates to opcode 0. This is the No-Operation.

The TsMops virtual machine should behave the same as original MOPS for all programs allowed in strict mode, and behave predictably and constistently for other programs.

== Building
This project uses npm and webpack. To generate the site, run:
----
npm install
npx webpack

Files will be placed in _dist_. Simply open index.html in your browser. An instance generated from main is also available at https://apfels.github.io/tsmops/.
